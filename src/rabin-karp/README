==================

This is the implementation of a feed-forward Bloom filter.
The code has been tested on a Linux 2.6.35 machine, gcc version 4.4.5.

CONFIGURING AND BUILDING

Before making, review the filter parameters in the Makefile:

    - the size of the non-cache-resident part of the filter,
    - the size of the cache-resident part of the filter,
    - the total number of hashes,
    - the number of hashes that only hash in the cache-resident part of the filter,
    - the path to a file on a hugetlbfs file system.
    - the minimum pattern length -- ideally it should be larger than 10 characters for effective filtering


RUNNING

For using super pages (huge pages in Linux):

    echo 100 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
    mount -t hugetlbfs nodev <huge_pages_mount_directory>

NOTE: the HUGEPAGE_FILE variable in the Makefile must be defined as:
    HUGEPAGE_FILE = '"<huge_pages_mount_directory>/<filename>"'

Running the filter, and then grep:

    ffbf patterns_file filtered_patterns.out < corpus > filtered_corpus.out
    grep -Ff filtered_patterns.out filtered_corpus.out

NOTE: The Bloom filter is only built in the first run, and saved in a file named "__bloom_filter_<patterns_file>",
    in the current folder. Subsequent runs will load the Bloom filter from the file.
    If the patterns_file is modified, the bloom filter file must be deleted.
